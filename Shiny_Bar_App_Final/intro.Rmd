<h2>Dataset and Analysis</h2><br>

<div class ="a">
<p class = "coerce">These datasets are from "American Community Survey of 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. The download data can be obtained here: <a href="http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html">United Stated Census Bureau</a> or here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/college-majors?select=majors-list.csv">Data Source [Kaggle]</a> . For the final project, in addition to creating this 'Shiny App' I will be conducting an exploration on  'Analysis I Tab' of the Economic Outcomes between the Majors within the Category 'Computers and Mathematics' using dataset: all_ages.csv for this study.  On the 'Dataset Bar' and 'Dataset Scatter' tabs, 'all_ages.csv' is available in plot form to observe the different values of a selected y variables, across all the majors and/or major categories for all ages of respondent.<br><br>I had planned on doing this and an additional exploration on 'Analysis II Tab' of the Economic Outcomes between the Categories of Majors, but the learning curve of building the 'Shiny app', precluded this analytical portion's completion at this time.  </p>
