<h2>Dataset and Analysis</h2>

<div class ="a">
<p>These datasets are from "American Community Survey of 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. The download data can be obtained here: <a href="http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html">United Stated Census Bureau</a> or here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/college-majors?select=majors-list.csv">Data Source [Kaggle]</a> . For the final project, in addition to creating this 'Shiny App' I will conduct an exploration on  'Analysis I Tab' of the Economic Outcomes between the Majors within the Category 'Computers and Mathematics'  using datasets: x, y and z for this study.  On the 'Dataset Tab', one of the datasets: 'all_ages.csv' is shown for an example of the distribution of the value of a selected y variable, across all the majors for all ages of respondent.<br><br>I had planned on doing an additional exploration on 'Analysis II Tab' of the Economic Outcomes between the Categories of Majors, but the learning curve of building the shiny app precluded this portion. I will leave it here so as I can still pursue this study for increasing the scope of my R abilities. </p>
